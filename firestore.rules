/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CityGenZ Reporting Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and reported issues,
 * and restricts access to municipality worker profiles.  Issue priorities are publicly readable but writable only with appropriate authorization (TODO).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/reportedIssues/{reportId}: Stores issues reported by each user.
 * - /municipalityWorkers/{workerId}: Stores municipality worker profiles.
 * - /issuePriorities/{issueId}: Stores issue priorities assigned to reported issues.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own profile data.
 * - Any authenticated user can view the list of all users (for admin purposes).
 * - Users can only read/write issues they have reported.
 * - Municipality worker profiles are only accessible by authenticated users(TODO: refine this).
 * - Issue priorities are readable by everyone. Write access is limited (TODO: define the logic).
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - ReportedIssue documents include the userId, enabling security rules to validate ownership
 *   without needing to fetch the user document.
